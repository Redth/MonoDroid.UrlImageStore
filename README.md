MonoDroid.UrlImageStore
==============================

What is it?
-----------
A utility library for Lazy Loading and Caching images from urls for your application.

It is very not at all working yet ;)
I simply created a spot to put this code, I'll be working on it soon.
Currently it's basically MonoTouch code, although I've done a bit of converting of things, but it won't compile yet
